        <h2>An Explanation of all things Smash Bros.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class ="introduction">
        This website's purpose is to teach you to play Smash Bros. This will be a comprehensive guide
        unless you are already that good then this is just a light overview. Any craft is hard to master and Smash Bros isn't going to be easy.
        It wil test your patience and you shouldn't play yourself down if you fail a few times. The basic concept of smash is to hit you opponent with attacks, increase their percentages,and blast the of the stage.
        HOWEVER, if you are new to smash then you should still read the rest of this website.You think you got the ability to commit to this? Then let me teach you how to Smash Bros..!
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="The Basics">
        <div class="Movement">
            <p>Movement is a very important part of any smash game. Tilting the left stick slightly will be walk and pushing it all the way is a run.
                When running if you put the left stick in the opposite direction you will get a turn-around animation. This animation you will want to avoid at all costs.
                Instead of putting in the opposite direction immediatly stop the joystick and then turn turn-around, this is also how you dash-dance.
            </p></div>
        <div class="Jumping">
            <img src="images/Jumpman.jpg" alt="Jumpman Picture">
            <p>The next part of movement is jumping. To jump use the X or Y button. Pressing it will give a full jump and tapping will give a short jump. 
                While jumping if you press down twice on the left stick you will preform a fast-fall. 
                You will know if you have performed a fast fall by a purple flash appearing.</p></div>
        <div class="Grabing">
                <p>To grab an opponent press the left or right buttons on the side on the top of the controller.</p>
                <p>When you grab an opponent you have the option to pummel to do so press the A button. 
                    Once you have finished pummeling press either up, down forward or back 
                    of where you are facing to throw them. </p></div>
        <div class="Shielding">
            <img src="images/Sheild.jpg" alt="Sheild Picture">
            <p>To shield or block an attack press either the right or left trigger.
                Your sheild though will become smaller over time and when hit, when your sheild completley runs out it will break and you will pop up into the air(unless you are jigglypuff then you just die)
                and you will be stunned. To get out of this stunned state press all of the button as fast as possible. Your shield will be completly useless against grabs
                When you can see an attack coming you can also parry by tapping the left or right trigger instead of holding the trigger</p></div>
        <div class="Kinds of Grouned Attacks">
            <p>Attacking is the most important part of Smash seeing as its a FIGHTING GAME. 
                There are two mains kinds of Attacks Grounded and Aerial Attacks.
                There are two buttons to do Grounded Attack A and B.</p></div>
        <div class="Grounded Neutrals">
                A is for neutral attacks and B is for special attacks. pressing A button will be a jab.
                There are two variations of the jab, gentleman jab and rapid jab.
                The next neutral attack is the dash attack. To perform one start to run and then press the A button.
                After that there is also tilt attacks. To perform a tilt attack lightly TILT the left stick and hit the A button.
                You might do a dash attack, but just keep at it..!
            </p>
            <p>There is another way to attack which is with the right joystick. 
                By angling it up, left, right, or down you will perform a smash attack. 
                These kinds of Attacks are essentail to gameplay and every player should know them.</p></div>
        <div class="Grounded Specials">
            <p>When you press the B button you will perform a special move. 
                Special moves like your tilts can be angled up, down, left, or right to perform a different kinds of special move.</p></div>
        
        <div class="Aerial Attacks">
            <img src="images/air attack.jpg" alt="Air Attack Picture">
            <p>For aerial attacks the B button will just be the same attack, 
                but in the air as for the A button you will perform Air Attacks</p>
            <p>To perform aerial an aerial attack press A in the air or press A and a direction either Up, Down, Left, Right, or Down. 
                There is also short hop aerial attacks. When you press A and X and a direction you will preform a short hop aerial.
                There are also Grab Airs. These are performed when you press grab in the air. These can also grba the ledge. 
                These can only be performed with the following characters.
                Samus, Dark Samus, Luigi (His grab air is a projectile), Young Link, Zero Suit Samus, Lucas, and Toon Link,
                Simon and Richter are special in the fact that their grabs don't hold the ledge but their direction aerials do.</p></div>

        <div class="General Smash Slang">
            <p>When talking to someone about Smash Bros you will need or will hear kinds of slang.
                When talking about Aerial attacks You will hear Fair which is taking F from Forward and the word Air to make the word Fair. 
                This also goes for Bair (Back Air), Uair (Up air), and Dair (Down Air) and grabing while in the air Zair(Grab Air). 
                This kind of logic is also applied to Tilts and Smash Attacks, 
                but is only applied to the forward direction and the letter is sepperate from the word like F-Tilt or F-Smash.
                You will also hear people refer to a characters abilities as a toolkit and the moves they can perform tier moveset.

        <div class="Intro to Advanced Norms">
            <p>
                Congrats! You have just made past 25% of this website. Now we will discuss the more Advanced side of Smash.
                With this knowledge you can enter your local and get at least past the first round of the losers bracket!

        <div class="Stale-Move Negation">
            <p>
                Stale-Move Negation is a mechanic introduced my Masahiro Sakurai to 
                encourage players to unlock a characters full potetial instead of spamming.
                The way stale-move negation works is that the game will keep track if the last nine moves your character has connected or hit 
                with this also includes sheilds and perceft sheilds. 
                If it detects a repeated move it will apply a multiplier that decreases its power. The table below shows the damage output. 
                The queue will reset if you are killed.

        <table>
            <tr>

        <div class="Frame Data">
            <p>
                *clap* So, Smash Bros Ultimate runs at 60 fps(frames per second). Each move has a certain amount of frames it takes to get 
                out a mvoe or its "start up". There is also a certain amount of frames the move stay out. In frame data there is also kinds of hits.
                There are sweet spots and sour spots. Sweet spots are the stronest the move gets and the sour is the weakest. There are also invincibility frames.
                Invincibility frames are the spots of a certain move on specific frames that cannot be damaged.
                <a href = "https://ultimateframedata.com">This is a link to whre you can find frame data of all the characters</a>

        <div class="Weight Class">
            <p>
                In Smash Bros. Each character has a specific weight class like in boxing or wrestling. 
                These factors influence how far a character is launched, how fast they fall, and overall feel and movement of the character.
                Each character has a weight class value and these values are how each character is ranked.Here is a table for each characters weight class.

                <p>
                    The Metagame or the game outside the game is all about psyching out your opponent rather than using raw skill.
                    This is fair and usually consists of Mindgames and discovering a players habits,
                     exploiting them, and absolutly dominating them.

                <p>
                    When playing smash, above average smash players will use 
                    Mind Games or startegies to put into use while playing. 
                    The main 5 ones are Predicting and Punishing, Baiting, Pressuring, Spacing, and Unpredictablity
                </p>
            <div class="Predicting and Punishing">
                <p>
                    One of the most used and most effective play styles is predicting and punishing your fow.
                    This mindgame focuses on you learing and your opponents playstyle, patterns and bad habits.
                    This staregy also utilizes the abilities of the character aswell. 
                    The similist example of this is after the opponent uses a laggy move like a smash attack and then you counter attack.
                    This strategy is very effective agianst spammers who are trying to make the game less fun for everyone.
                    This strat requires personal risk. 
                    This tactic is commonly used when a person tries to get up from ledge or recovering.
                </p>
            </div>    
            <div class="Baiting">
                <p>
                    The next mind game is Baiting. This is when you trick your opponent to get into a vulnerable position.
                    Like predicting it forces the opponent into an unfavorable circumstance and then punishing them.
                    Baiting can also be done by pretending to do one move but doing another. 
                    Like how can use F-smash instead of missles with samus to punish sheild with a grab. You getting the hang of this?  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Pressuring">
                <p>
                    Pressuring, which is the next mindgame/strat is all about being in the opponents face and attacking at all times.
                    This does not spamming, your attacks have to be cacluated and consise.
                    This strategy is best with fast characters for they add an element of unpredictablity.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Conditioning">
                <p>
                    Conditioning or writing is a strat about doing something repeatedly and then mixing it up
                    Reading an oponent menas predicting what they will do, conditioning is about reading thier read, if that makes sense.
                </p>

    <div class="Your Main">
        <div class="Choosing your main">
                <p>
                    Now that you know the basics and even some advanced knowledge, 
                    its time to talk about who you're going to play or "main". Now with 89 characters there is a lot to choose from.
                    Luckily you have an amazing website to help guide you. 
                    Each character has a Archetype and these Archetypes have sub Archetypes. 
                    Each character can be in multiple Sub-Archetypes, but not in multiple Archtpyes. 
                    There are three main Archetypes Offensive, Defensive, and Flexible. 
                    The examples that I give aren't definent and are just what I think would be a good fit 
                </p>
        <div class="Offensive">
            <p>Offensive characters have the tool kit that is made for attacking 
                constantly and approaching.</p>
            <p> Firstly there is the All-Rounder. This kind of charcter is pretty good at everything, but not great at anything.
                These characters are great for people who don't want to be professionaly good at Smash and just want to have a good time.
                They don't have a spefic game plan and just adapt to what comes there way. 
                These characters are Mario, Yoshi, Palutena, Pit/Dark Pit, Ryu/Ken, Terry, Ness, 
                Corrin, Link, Cloud, and Mr. Game and Watch.
            </p>
            <p>Rushdown characters are fast that are excellent in combos, and juggling
                (keeping your opponent in the air by using aerials). 
                They are purelly offensive with some projectiles. Examples are Fox, Sheik, and Wolf.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressuer Characters are like Rushdown characters, but only use projectiles 
                as an offensive technique adn are frequent users of baiting opponents and love to combo.
                 Exampeles of these are Pikachu, Peach, Roy(Sword Dude) and Kirby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hit and Run characters act like the crime. They hit the opponent and they run. 
                They hit with a few powerful coordinated attacks and then get out of the attack range. 
                Exapamples are Captain Flason, Greninja, Wii Fit Trainer, and Bowser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mix-Up characters heavily use mindgames to exploit there opponents weaknesses.
                 They are balanced,but not as balanced as All-Rounders,
                 since they can't be defense and have even more noticable and exploitable weaknesses.
                 Examples are Falco, Lucas, Rosalina & Luma and Diddy Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zone-Breakers you guess, break the distance between Zoners while
                 creating their own that which they can control. Examples are Sheik, Zero Suit Samus(ZSS),
                 Sephiroth, and Sora.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glass Cannons save some of the strongest attacks to in the game with the deficet of having
                a weak sauce defense. They attack with great speed and range, but the defense is just so trash that theres
                an entire archetpye. Having bad defense doesn't mean being light there are mid weights that are Glass Cannons.
                 Examples are Zelda, Mewtwo, Mr Game & Watch, Pichu, Jigglypuff, and Pyra/Mythra.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dominating characters have the speed of rush downa and pressure characters, but have high attack power.
                they tend to have exploitable weaknesses, but defense isn't one of them. Examples are Roy and Cloud. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Footsies have increbible ground combat capabilities, speed, and tend to be less combo focussed.
                Examples are Ike, Little Mac, Greninja, and Ryu
            </p>
            <p>
                Tag team characters are two characters, who are on the battle feild at the same tiem in one slot.
                Examples are Ice Climbers, and Rosalina & Luma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional fighting characters fight like there in a game like Street Fighter or Tekken 7.
                Examples are Ryu, Ken, Terry, and Kazuya
            </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="Defensive">
            <p>
                Defensive characters's tool kit is made for keeping distance 
                and to bait them into setups, exploit weaknesses and delivering a punishing blow. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Zoner characters control the stage with a large range of projectiles and sometimes lack speed and power.
                Examples are Samus/Dark Samus, Link, King Dedede, Villager, Duck Hunt, and Min Min.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bait and Punish characters are characters that take the most advantage of Baiting mind-games
                Examples are Bowser Jr., Captain Falcon, Wario, Steve, and Diddy Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trappers have indirect options and trap the opponets and evade thier opponents. They are pretty hard
                to play as and rely on mind games and pressure. Examples are Pac-Man, Robin, and Snake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turtle characters hit with projetiles from far away and with indirect moves. THey dont favor fighting up-close,
                but have fast meele moves. Examples are Link, Samus/Dark Samus, Villager, Isabelle, and Palutena.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep away characters are infuriating characters that run away from the fight(totally not salty or bias opinion in any way, shape , or form
                ). Examples are Samus and Sonic
            </p>
            <p>
                Half-Grapplers are a toughy using grabs as a main aprt of their strategy, but are generally offensive characters with not many set-ups.
                 They are Quazi offensive and defensive, but aren't balanced enough to be flexible. Examples are Luigi, Incineroar, Ness and Donkey Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stage controllers controll the stage, big shocker I know. Examples are Duck Hunt, Mega Man, and Snake
            </p>
        <div class="Flexible">
            <p>
                Dynamic characters have a toolkit that can 
                alternate between offensive and defensive playstlyes taking the best of both worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one aura character and its Lucario. The more damage he takes the stronger he gets and he is the first come-back mechanic.
            </p>
            <p> Precision characters use specific sweet spots to be the most effective. Examples are Marh, Zelda, Ridley, Roy, and Mr. Game & Watch
            </p>
    <div class="Combos">
        To put it simply combos are strings of attacks that can rack up damage or can completly demolish a stock. 
        0-Death combos are few and far between absolutly deleting a stock from 0. 
        Go to Frenzy Light's Playlist for all of the Bread and Butter Combos for each character.
